Variational Monte Carlo with Jax
================================

Structure
---------
All of the simulation files used to produce the results in the paper are found
in the /VMC folder, alongside a Utilities directory which contains all of the 
necessary supporting functionality for the scripts. 

Workflow
---------
Data resulting from the scripts is stored in the /Data directory, if processing
of the data is needed it is performed by a process script in the /process folder.
Finally the plotting routines are stored in the /plot directory and save the plots
in the /plots directory.
